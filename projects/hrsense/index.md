# Heartbeat Sensor

### Motivation

During my sophomore year, I spent a night in the hospital for unimportant reasons (*cough exhaustion cough*). During my stay, they had me hooked up to a pulse-ox, which also gave a readout for pulse. This became relevant, because apparently there was a built-in alarm that would go off if a patient's pulse dipped below 45. Mine did this whenever I started to fall asleep, which was not helpful for the whole exhaustion thing.

45 is quite low for a heart rate, especially considering I'm not an athlete by any means. I've been wondering since then what my heart rate is like at night, and whether the fact that my HR was so low that night only due to dehydration/exhaustion/starvation/what have you.

So of course I built a sensor to track it for me! Because buying a fitbit would be too easy.
