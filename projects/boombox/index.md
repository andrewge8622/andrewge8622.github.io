# A Basic Boombox

### Motivation 

Over the course of Princeton's junior EE design course, I found myself experimenting with audio circuits. Specifically, I was trying to use microphones to pick up the sound of a drone (worked surprisingly poorly). When that failed, I tried to generate a loud squeal that could be picked up by the mic. (For reference, my partner and I decided to do a drone following platform as our independent project). 

Along the way, I found myself using the vaunted LM386, an audio amplifying IC. It's a finnicky, temperamental chip, but it can produce surprisingly clean (and extremely loud) audio if the right components are used. Heading into the summer, I wanted to work with this chip some more, and decided that building a boombox might be a good use of the chip. Along the way, I did some other cool things too (designing my first personal PCBs, developing a volume control board, making a laser cut enclosure). Here's the end product!

### Lessons Learned
* When working with sensitive analog circuitry, a good breadboard is infinitely better than a cheap one. And a PCB is even better
* Even if you think you've hooked up the wires correctly, check again. I flipped the + and - inputs more times than I can remember
* Buy heatshrink. And put the heatshrink on before you start soldering the wires to things
* When assembling tightly constrained components, think about what you *won't* be able to access afterwards
