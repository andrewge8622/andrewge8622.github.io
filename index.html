        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Andrew!</h1>
				<p>I'm a senior at Princeton University, studying electrical engineering. In my free time, 
					I enjoy building things out of ICs, breathing solder smoke (not really), and thinking of 
					projects that I probably won't have time for.</p>
				<p> This website is a record of a few projects I've been working on, mostly done at Hackerdojo in Santa Clara. 
					I'm choosing to put all of this online because I anticipate at some point I'll spill coffee on my project
					notebook and I'd like to have a record of what I've learned. <p>
				<p> If you like what you read, and have any questions, interesting opportunities, or project ideas, 
					feel free to e-mail me at <a href="mailto:age@princeton.edu" target="_top">age@princeton.edu </a> <p>
